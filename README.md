If needed, we can also show how to use a webhook. This will add probably like 5 minutes.

Code tutorial given in

https://testdriven.io/blog/flask-stripe-tutorial/

Not that I changed some mistakes though


Idea on walkthrough parts:

1. Start with template, but don't have price-id set. Log into stripe, get API Keys, create a product (2 min)
2. Explain workflow through server and main.js code, add product ID (3 min)
3. Show example test success and failure, show it pop up on stripe website, explain need for HTTPS in prod (2 min)
4. Walk through webhook code and how to test(5 min?)
5. Maybe show how events would be integrated with the server in prod (1 min)
